# Customer-Churn-Model-Training - TF Deep Learning model vs traditional models

Model training using TensorFlow to predicting customer churn with deep learning. In comparison, several more traditional models and an ensemble method are tested and compared.

All are done without tuning for a base comparison. 

Many people use deep learning as a go-to assuming it will produce the best results, even if it is an unexplainable black-box model. This test is to show a simple example of how that is not alwasy the case.
